Weather datasets from year 2010 to 2019 is gathered, read and combined using Hadoop Spark for analysis on climatic changes over a decade.
RDD is used to collect all types of weather information like hottest and coldest area (each year and overall) along with precipitation and gust details date wise from the huge dataset

Would need to store the weather data in the Hadoop Distributed File System to access and analyse the data.
